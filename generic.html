					<p>My name is Jacob, and I am the president of Green365. I am a sophomore at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. I am majoring in Bioproducts Engineering, which is sustainably focused chemical engineering. In my free time, I play disc golf, basketball, soccer, and volleyball with my friends. I found my passion for the environment on a boundary waters trip in my junior year of high school. Ever since I have tried to do as much as I can for the environment. My two favorite outdoor destinations I have been to are Acadia, Maine, and Machu Picchu.</p>

					</div>
					<p><p>My name is Claire, and I’m a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I’m majoring in Industrial and Systems Engineering. I love to run, cook vegan recipes, and read in my free time. My passion for the environment came from growing up camping and when I learned all about how your daily life choices are linked to climate change. In 2018-2019 I served on the City of Bloomington’s Sustainability Commission as the youth seat. My favorite outdoor destinations are the Boundary Waters and the Minnesota river bottoms.</p>

						<img src="images/Nate_Twardock.jpg" alt="Pic 02" />
					</div>
					<p>Hello all, my name is Nate Twardock and I am a Sophomore at the University of Minnesota studying Mechanical Engineering. I’m originally from Grayslake, Illinois where I grew up playing Baseball and Golf. I love watching sports and am a big Cubs fan. I’ve always loved being outside, whether it's biking, skiing, hiking, whatever the activity, but after a recent study abroad trip to Belize, I realized that I’ve taken the amazing world that we live on for granted. That is why I joined 365 Green, to implement changes to my daily life to become more sustainable. Furthermore, if you are looking for a 2v2 clash royale partner do not choose me. Mitchel Medvec is more superior at the game.</p>

					<p>Hey, my name is Kai, and I am a sophomore at Drake University in Des Moines Iowa. I am studying marketing and economics, and I am pursuing a minor in graphic design. Any time I can get outside to play games or sports with my friends you can bet I’ll be there! I really gained an appreciation for the environment as I grew up going on different trips showcasing the different types of natural beauty throughout the world. When you get out and partake in what nature has to offer it can really help you appreciate what you need to do to help. My absolute favorite nature location in the world is the mountains of British Columbia.</p>

					<p>Hi! My name is Maddie, and I am a sophomore at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.  I am majoring in Health Sciences with a minor is Spanish, and my goal is to go to Physician’s Assistant school after I get my undergrad.  I enjoy making art, playing soccer, hiking, hammocking, and spending time with my friends.  My interest in sustainability and helping the environment comes from experience and education.  It’s hard to appreciate the beauty and power of the world around us without diving right into it and being open to learning as much as possible.  My favorite place that I have visited is Vancouver, Canada, and if I could travel anywhere in the world I would choose Thailand.</p>

					<p>Hello, my name is Mitchel Medvec.  I am originally from Lake City Minnesota, and

						With my limited amount of free time, I like to play guitar and piano, play sports like tennis and soccer, go fishing, hiking, and I like to take photos of the night sky.  My love for the outdoors and the environment started at a young age, when I found myself outside more than I was inside.  One fun fact about me is that I want to go into space one day to see our amazing earth from a new perspective.  I am also a superior 2v2 Clash Royale player.
